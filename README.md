## Description

Purpose of the application is to provide easy way to track UFO vehicles, which are currently in Earth's airspace.
By looking at the map you can easily determine a vehicle's position and direction of movement.
Thanks to data section, you can quickly read the other vehicle's data (its galactic registration number, origin planet,
if they are friends or enemies and exact coordinates).

Also, when hovering over particular vehicle`s section you can easily see on the map, which vehicle you are analyzing 
(proper icon on the map is getting red color and map is automatically centering at this vehicle).
You also can adjust the vehicles displayed on the map by filtering them out (using search input on the top of the map).
